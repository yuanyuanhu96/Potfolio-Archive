            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              I spent two summer in Nokia Software Venture Studio, working on
              new product innovation. The projects I worked on, helps shifting
              our business to a high return market. In the Venture Studio, We
              considered human factors and user experience as a key drive to
              success, even from the earlest stage of the product development.
            </p>

            <h3>How did I do that?</h3>
            <p>
              First, I captured people's ideas quickly and visualized that by
              diagramming, storyboarding and prototyping. For me, prototyping
              doesn't limit us to fewer choices. Instead, it helps us, our team,
              and stakeholders to see how ideas comes to life. Then, more
              meaningful and efficient discussion can happen.
            </p>

            <p>
              Second, I listened to and served our team members. My team members
              came from economics, engineering, and cognitive science
              backgrounds. Their refreshing thoughts and inspiring perspectives
              are the fortune for our team. As the member with more design
              expertise, I also played the role as facilitator and knowledge
              broker to help people better landing their facinating thoughts to
              the product.
            </p>

            <p>
              Last and most important, I know how important human is and I
              advocated for that. Human factors, as a main factor that affects a
              product's success, is usually underestimated. As a designer, I
              always have users in mind and questioning myself about how our
              product reached to the user, how they interact, and what people
              get from it.

              class="align-center"

            <h2>Summary</h2>
            <p>
              During my five months in Narrative Science, I worked on onboarding
              to early use of our new data storytelling product, Lexio. The way
              people start using Lexio haven't been shaped and its crutial to
              Lexio's success. To better set people's expectation and help them
              make real changes with our product, I developed the following
              solutions:<br />
              <br />
              1) A suite of solutions across touchpoints to consistantly
              communicate our value, including who we are, how to use our
              product, and how we compare with other competitors. I modulized
              both the form and content, so design, customer sucess, and
              marketing team can grab from the library, implement and evolve it.
              <br />
              <br />
              2) An easy to adopt sharing experience to make Lexio more
              actionable. Compared with our competitors, Lexio, with its plain
              language data story, is supior in communication. Sharing and
              commenting serve this goal, and also brings qualitative aspect to
              Lexio, which is missing for many other data product but crutial
              for make real decisions.
              <br />
              <br />
              3) Model of current onboarding and sharing experience and
              human-centered criteras. It helps product team, to evaluate ideas
              in a more desciplined way - from user's standpoints and connecting
              dors in the system.
