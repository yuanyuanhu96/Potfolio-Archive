          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            Lexio is our newly launched Business Intelligence tool, which turns
            your data from Salesforce, Google Analytics, etc into meaningful
            insights and stories for the teams to do their daily job. We are the
            leading player in the field of data storytelling and have become a
            part of Salesforce. <br /><br />During my internship, I worked in
            our three-people design and research team. I designed the onboarding
            experience and sharing function. It helped users to understand the
            story behind data and empowers them to take action, thus, doubling
            one-week retention and helping us scale to more organizations.

        <h1>Challenge of growth and retention</h1>
      </div>

      <p>
        With the mission of humanizing data analytics, we decided to use
        language as the media to communicate insights. That means we are very
        different from our competitors. How can we better communicate our
        product and bring unique value to the teams is a big opportunity and
        challenge for our retention and growth. The solution I designed directly
        contributes to the weekly retention rate and leads to long-term
        contracts.

            Sharing, as the main way of acting on Lexio's insights, provides a
            lot of value to the user and the team.

          We talked to 9 users of Lexio, The user sample includes team managers,
          sales representatives, and marketing experts, given the existing
          active users. we asked them questions from generally how they are
          using Lexio, what drives them to share, to what content and how do
          they share.

        <p>
          I analyzed and synthesized the research data, from which we (1)
          understood deeply what users wanted to achieve with our product. (2)
          had an overview of the current sharing experience and understood the
          pain points. (3) tested a few concepts.

          After the research readout, I planned and hosted a brainstorming
          section with the whole product team. I framed research insights into
          solution-oriented HMWs. Rather than just listing the HMWs, I put them
          into wireframe-like boxes to make them connected and tangible. That
          helped our participants to digest a lot of information, and use that
          for brainstorming. After participants run out of their initial idea, I
          let them move ideas to the journey, so they can see which ideas come
          together, and build upon each other's ideas. Here is just an overview
          of our design principles.

            We went a little bit broad beyond sharing and commenting and got a
            lot of ideas about the collaboration function. I captured and
            synthesized all these ideas and started designing for them.
          </p>

          <p>
            How do we prioritize these features? I connected with PMs, heads of
            design, and CPO. We all agreed that rather than find the smallest
            cost/value. Proving our value as a product is the top priority.
            Therefore, I sorted all the ideas according to the problem it's
            trying to solve and highlighted the one that solves the problem that
            the user cares about the most.
