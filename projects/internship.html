              class="align-center"
              alt="Git Bash"

            <p>
              I spent two summers in Nokia Software Venture Studio, working on
              new product innovation. The projects I worked on help shifting our
              business to a high-return market. Due to the NDA, I cannot share
              the content of these ongoing projects.
              <br />
            </p>

            <h3>How did my design capability help the team succeed?</h3>
            <p>
              First, I captured people's ideas quickly and
              <b>visualized </b> that by diagramming, storyboarding, and
              prototyping. For me, prototyping doesn't limit us to fewer
              choices. Instead, it helps us, our team, and stakeholders to see
              how ideas come to life. Then, we can have more meaningful and
              efficient discussions.
            </p>

            <p>
              Second, I listened to and served our team members. My team members
              came from economics, engineering, and cognitive science
              backgrounds. Their refreshing thoughts and inspiring perspectives
              are the fortunes of our team. As the member with more design
              expertise, I also played the role of <b>facilitator</b> and
              knowledge broker to help people better landing their fascinating
              thoughts on the product.
            </p>

            <p>
              Last and most important, I know how important human is and I
              advocated for that. Human factors are crucial for product success,
              but it is usually underestimated. As a designer, I always have
              <b> users in my mind</b>. I keep asking myself the following
              questions: how will our product meet the users? How will they
              interact? What value can we provide?
            </p>
            <br />
            <br />
          </div>
          <br />
          <div id="step2" class="dowebok">
            <img
              class="align-center"
              alt="Git Bash"
              src="../assets/img/intern/NS.png"
              width="600px"
            />
            <br />
            <br />
            <a href=""></a>
            <p>
              During my five months in Narrative Science, I worked on onboarding
              to the early use of our new data storytelling product,
              <a href="https://narrativescience.com/lexio/" target="_blank"
                >Lexio.</a
              >
              The way people start using Lexio hasn’t been shaped and it’s
              crucial to Lexio's success. To better set people's expectation and
              help them make real changes with our product, I developed the
              following solutions:<br />
              <br />

              1) A suite of solutions across touchpoints to consistently
              communicate our value, including who we are, how to use our
              product, and how we compare with other competitors. I modularized
              both the form and content, so design, customer success, and
              marketing team can grab from the library, implement and evolve it.

              <br />
              <br />
              2) An easy to adopt sharing experience to make Lexio more
              actionable. Compared with our competitors, Lexio, with its plain
              language data story, is superior in communication. Sharing and
              commenting serve this goal, and also bring a qualitative aspect to
              Lexio, which is missing for many other data products but critical
              for the user to make real decisions.
              <br />
              <br />
              3) Models of current onboarding and sharing experience and
              human-centered criteria for potential solutions. It helps the
              product team evaluate ideas in a more disciplined way - from the
              user's standpoints and connecting dots in the system.

          <h3>
            Prior to the experiences above, I also worked as a product manager
            for mobile APPs and worked on academic research projects about
            Human-Computer Interaction and Artificial Intelligence. <br />
            <br />I really appreciate all these experiences. They enable me to
            think from many perspectives, to understand the whole journey of a
            product, to collaborate with different people, and, ultimately, to
            create desirable, feasible, and viable products and services for
            people.
