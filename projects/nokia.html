          <h3>Introduction</h3>
          <p>
            This is one project I did in Nokia Software Venture Studio. I lead
            the research to understand the current experiences of remote teams.
            From there we created this collaboration Studio with cutting-edge AI
            technology as well as out-of-box solutions, to help teams
            communicate, adopt new tools, and increase work efficiency.

      <h3>How did my design capability help the team succeed?</h3>
      <p>
        First, I captured people's ideas quickly and
        <b>visualized </b> that by diagramming, storyboarding, and prototyping.
        For me, prototyping doesn't limit us to fewer choices. Instead, it helps
        us, our team, and stakeholders to see how ideas come to life. Then, we
        can have more meaningful and efficient discussions. <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Second, I listened to and served our team members. My team members came
        from economics, engineering, and cognitive science backgrounds. Their
        refreshing thoughts and inspiring perspectives are the fortunes of our
        team. As the member with more design expertise, I also played the role
        of <b>facilitator</b> and knowledge broker to help people better landing
        their fascinating thoughts on the product. <br />
      </p>

      <p>
        Last and most important, I know how important human is and I advocated
        for that. Human factors are crucial for product success, but it is
        usually underestimated. As a designer, I always have
        <b> users in my mind</b>. I keep asking myself the following questions:
        how will our product meet the users? How will they interact? What value
        can we provide? <br />
      </p>
