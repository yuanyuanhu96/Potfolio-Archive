                  After synthesizing our primary research, the pattern popped
                  up. It shows that residents usually get trapped with this
                  system by rather their little mistake, or confusion of the
                  traffic rules -- some of these rules are even unreasonable.
                  This little accident gives residents an initial non-moving
                  violation ticket. Without dealing with it properly, the ticket
                  can easily double, the penalty will come, eventually, debts
                  become unaffordable.
                </p>

                <p>
                  The City of Chicago claims that they are trying hard to help
                  these residents, while the residents don’t feel the help is
                  available.

              Reflections
            </h2>
            <p>
              - Non-moving violation ticket and it's payment engage many
              stakeholders and was very complex from the beginning, so we
              simplified that as a two-side model, and focusing on the main
              conflicts to better solve the problem.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Since the service is related to the penalty, obviously, many
              residents are quite resistant to that. No one is 100% rational
              people, so we should consider their emotions and how will emotions
              affect behavior - Behavior economics will play a key role in this
              situation.
            </p>
            <p>
              - Dealing with conflicting situations like this, we should not be
              just engaged with fixing what is wrong, but we should always be
              aware of how can we make it even better.
