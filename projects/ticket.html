                            <p>After synthesizing our primary research, the pattern popped up. It shows that residents usually get trapped with this system by rather their little mistake, or confusion of the traffic rules -- some of these rules are even unreasonable. This little accident gives residents an initial non-moving violation ticket. Without dealing with it properly, the ticket can easily double, the penalty will come, eventually, debts become unaffordable.</p>

                    <h2><div class="number">9.</div>Reflections</h2>
  <p>
        - Non-moving violation ticket and it's payment engage many stakeholders and was very complex from the beginning, so we simplified that as a two-side model, and focusing on the main conflicts to better solve the problem.
      </p>
 <p>
         - Since the service is related to the penalty, obviously, many residents are quite resistant to that. No one is 100% rational people, so we should consider their emotions and how will emotions affect behavior - Behavior economics will play a key role in this situation.
</p>
 <p>

         - Dealing with conflicting situations like this, we should not be just engaged with fixing what is wrong, but we should always be aware of how can we make it even better.
