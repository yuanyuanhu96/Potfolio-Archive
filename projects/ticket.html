            After synthesizing our primary research, the pattern popped up. It
            shows that residents usually get trapped with this system by rather
            their little mistake, or confusion of the traffic rules -- some of
            these rules are even unreasonable. This little accident gives
            residents an initial non-moving violation ticket. Without dealing
            with it properly, the ticket can easily double, the penalty will
            come, eventually, debts become unaffordable.
          </p>

          <p>
            The City of Chicago claims that they are trying hard to help these
            residents, while the residents don’t feel the help is available.

        Most of our participants thoughts the fine of the non-moving violation
        is too high, while people with different income levels react so

      <h2>Reflections & More</h2>
      <p>
        - Non-moving violation ticket and its payment engage many stakeholders
        and was very complex from the beginning, so we simplified that as a
        two-side model, and focusing on the main conflicts to better solve the
        problem.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Since the service is related to the penalty, obviously, many residents
        are quite resistant to that. No one is 100% rational people, so we
        should consider their emotions and how will emotions affect behavior -
        Behavior economics will play a key role in this situation.
      </p>
      <p>
        - Dealing with conflicting situations like this, we should not be just
        engaged with fixing what is wrong, but we should always be aware of how
        can we make it even better.
