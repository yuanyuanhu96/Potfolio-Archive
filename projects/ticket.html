                    <p>After synthesizing our primary research, the pattern popped up. It shows that residents usually get trapped with this system by rather their little mistake, or confusion of the traffic rules -- some of these rules are even unreasonable. This little accident gives residents an initial non-moving violation ticket. Without dealing with it properly, the ticket can easily double, the penalty will come, eventually, debts become unaffordable.</p>

                    <p>The City of Chicago claims that they are trying hard to help these residents, while the residents don’t feel the help is available.
