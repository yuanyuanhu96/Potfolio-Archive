          <p>
            Working in the gig economy is a decision made in the effort to have
            more freedom, yet it is often met with many complex and
            time-consuming tasks. We designed CrewCrew cafe for as hub for indy
            workers to get support.

        An indy (or indie) worker is an independent worker. Compared with other
        employees, they usually handle many things on their own. Among these 5
        types we are focusing on steady indies, who chose to work independently
        and wanted a balanced life.

        <h1>
          Fidelity CRCR cafe provides a community to the indy workers. It brings
          the sense of belonging, career support and lot others.
        </h1>
      </div>

      <img
        class="crcr-center"
        alt="Git Bash"
        src="../assets/img/crcr/concept.png"
      />
      <p>
        As an indy worker, they go through so many difficulties in their journey
        being alone and making decisions all on their own everytime. The key
        challenges we identified was 1.Lack of community space, they need a way
        to connect with others. 2.Lack of accessibility, they need better access
        to pool of skills, experts and tools. 3.Lack of reference point, they
        need a way to compare themselves with the others to feel safe,
        understanding that they are on the right track.
      </p>

      <p>
        So, we made three design principles, First, let’s provide 1.physical
        touchpoints, where they can hang out and have coffee with the others, a
        place full of conversation and valuable information. 2.we want to
        provide accessible resources and tools in a package. Quick and easy
        access to the experts, workshops and skill pools. 3.Provide opportunity
        to network and access data of others. Understand where others are at and
        find out their future path.

          <p>
            The reservation system provides gig workers a sense of belonging.
            Gig worker’s one of the biggest issue is that they are normally
            working alone and it’s hard to get feedbacks. CRCR cafe will act as
            sort of a one-day company for them.

      <h2>Reflections</h2>
      <p>
        During this project, we were able to approach the problem with the
        perspective of the industry, connected with actual researchers and
        designers in the field, while we also tried to propose an outside view
        that challenges industry orthodoxies. We started from crazy ideas and
        validated them by many rounds of testing and iterations. There is no end
        of design, but I am proud of what we achieved here. Here are the three
        main lessons I learned from this project:
        <li>
          There are a lot of traps in the UI design, and no design can survive
          from the very beginning to the end. We can only make better designs by
          learning from our users.
        </li>

        <li>
          A delightful, surprising, beautiful, and thoughtful moment in the
          experience, so-called sizzles can differentiate your product and
          service from others and makes it even meaningful.
        </li>
        <li>
          There are different ways to do the design -someone prefers to start
          from a small point and then expands the success, some tend to start
          from a big vision. A good designer should be able to switch from these
          two mindsets.
        </li>
      </p>
