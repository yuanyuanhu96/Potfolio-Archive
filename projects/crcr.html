              Working in the gig economy is a decision made in the effort to
              have more freedom, yet it is often met with many complex and
              time-consuming tasks. We designed CrewCrew cafe for as hub for
              indy workers to get support.

            <h3>Who is indy worker</h3>
            <p>
              An indy (or indie) worker is an independent worker. It is a broad
              term, and can cover the self-employed, freelancers, contractors,
              gig workers. They work for them, and are responsible for paying
              yourself. Compared with other employees, they usually handle many
              things on their own.
            </p>
            <h3>What we provide</h3>
            <p>
              First, We decided to provide lots of physical touchpoints, where
              self-employed workers can hang out and have coffee with the
              others, a place full of conversation and valuable information.
              Second, we planned a space filled with accessible resources and
              tools. Quick and easy access to the experts, workshops, and skill
              pools. Lastly, we set up opportunities for them to network and
              access data of others, allowing them to navigate their position by
              anchoring from reference points.

              Throughout the class, we started from defining What “is” the
              current problem by conducting user tests and secondary researches,
              then distilled the findings into the model of what “is” by making
              a journey map, then we suggested the model of what “could be” from
              the insights by making user flows and use cases, then we ran
              usability test, manifested our use cases by as What “could be” the
              potential solution for the future.

              At the end of the workshop, we narrowed down several concepts into

              and 3. Activities inside the cafe.

            <p>
              The reservation system provides gig workers a sense of belonging.
              Gig worker’s one of the biggest issue is that they are normally
              working alone and it’s hard to get feedbacks. CRCR cafe will act
              as sort of a one-day company for them.

            <h2>Reflections</h2>
            <p>
              During this project, we were able to approach the problem with the
              perspective of the industry, connected with actual researchers and
              designers in the field, while we also tried to propose an outside
              view that challenges industry orthodoxies. We started from crazy
              ideas and validated them by many rounds of testing and iterations.
              There is no end of design, but I am proud of what we achieved
              here. Here are the three main lessons I learned from this project:
            </p>

            <p>
              <li>
                There are a lot of traps in the UI design, and no design can
                survive from the very beginning to the end. We can only make
                better designs by learning from our users.
              </li>

              <li>
                A delightful, surprising, beautiful, and thoughtful moment in
                the experience, so-called sizzles can differentiate your product
                and service from others and makes it even meaningful.
              </li>
              <li>
                There are different ways to do the design -someone prefers to
                start from a small point and then expands the success, some tend
                to start from a big vision. A good designer should be able to
                switch from these two mindsets.
              </li>
            </p>
