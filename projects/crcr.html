          An indy (or indie) worker is an independent worker. Compared with
          other employees, they usually handle many things on their own. Among
          these 5 types we are focusing on steady indies, who chose to work
          independently and wanted a balanced life.

        <p>
          We started from defining What “is” the current problem by conducting
          user tests and secondary researches, then distilled the findings into
          the model of what “is” by making a journey map, then we suggested the
          model of what “could be” from the insights by making user flows and
          use cases, then we ran usability test, manifested our use cases by as
          What “could be” the potential solution for the future.

          As an indy worker, they go through so many difficulties in their
          journey being alone and making decisions all on their own everytime.
          The key challenges we identified was 1.Lack of community space, they
          need a way to connect with others. 2.Lack of accessibility, they need
          better access to pool of skills, experts and tools. 3.Lack of
          reference point, they need a way to compare themselves with the others
          to feel safe, understanding that they are on the right track.

          />
        </p>

        <p>
          So, we made three design principles, First, let’s provide 1.physical
          touchpoints, where they can hang out and have coffee with the others,
          a place full of conversation and valuable information. 2.we want to
          provide accessible resources and tools in a package. Quick and easy
          access to the experts, workshops and skill pools. 3.Provide
          opportunity to network and access data of others. Understand where
          others are at and find out their future path.

              plan tab gets created based on the consulting results. If the user

              Bob uses the mobile APP to explore the community. There are more
              function unlocked upon his arriving. One of that is skill trade,
              where he can either trade his skill in different ways, or find
              some skillful person.

        <h2>Reflections</h2>
        <p>
          During this project, we were able to approach the problem with the
          perspective of the industry, connected with actual researchers and
          designers in the field, while we also tried to propose an outside view
          that challenges industry orthodoxies. We started from crazy ideas and
          validated them by many rounds of testing and iterations. There is no
          end of design, but I am proud of what we achieved here. Here are the
          three main lessons I learned from this project:
        </p>

        <p>
          <li>
            There are a lot of traps in the UI design, and no design can survive
            from the very beginning to the end. We can only make better designs
            by learning from our users.
          </li>

          <li>
            A delightful, surprising, beautiful, and thoughtful moment in the
            experience, so-called sizzles can differentiate your product and
            service from others and makes it even meaningful.
          </li>
          <li>
            There are different ways to do the design -someone prefers to start
            from a small point and then expands the success, some tend to start
            from a big vision. A good designer should be able to switch from
            these two mindsets.
          </li>
        </p>
