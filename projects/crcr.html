              Working in the gig economy is a decision made in the effort to
              have more freedom, yet it is often met with many complex and
              time-consuming tasks.

            <h2>Process</h2>

            <p>
              Fidelity Investments wants to create an experience model to build
              trust amongst the self-employed individuals, so-called indy
              workers. Our group decided to build a community space to reinforce
              the sense of belonging and provide support for the job of jobs. in
              the indy community by using the assets that Fidelity already can
              do the best.
            </p>

            <p>
              Throughout the class, we started from defining What “is” the
              current problem by conducting user tests and secondary researches,
              then distilled the findings into the model of what “is” by making
              a journey map, then we suggested the model of what “could be” from
              the insights by making user flows and use cases, then we ran
              usability test, manifested our use cases by as What “could be” the
              potential solution for the future.
            </p>

            <p><img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/crcr/crcr-02.png" /></p>

            <p>
              First, We decided to provide lots of physical touchpoints, where
              self-employed workers can hang out and have coffee with the
              others, a place full of conversation and valuable information.
              Second, we planned a space filled with accessible resources and
              tools. Quick and easy access to the experts, workshops, and skill
              pools. Lastly, we set up opportunities for them to network and
              access data of others, allowing them to navigate their position by
              anchoring from reference points.

            <h2>Use cases</h2>

            <p>
              At the end of the workshop, we narrowed down several concepts into
              three use cases. 1. Reserving for a visit, 2. Entering the cafe
              and 3. Activities inside the cafe.
            </p>

            <p><img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/crcr/crcr-03.png" /></p>

            <h3>USE CASE 1. Reserving for a visit</h3>
            <p>
              The reservation system provides gig workers a sense of belonging.
              Gig worker’s one of the biggest issue is that they are normally
              working alone and it’s hard to get feedbacks. CRCR cafe will act
              as sort of a one-day company for them.
            </p>

            <p><img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/crcr/crcr-04.png" /></p>

            <p>
              Bob opens the app to register for a visit. He can see the overall
              layout of the place to understand what he wants to do. Then, he
              fills out the schedule, personal information, and check out the
              estimated members for that day.
            </p>
            <p><img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/crcr/crcr-05.png" /></p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>USE CASE 2. Entering the cafe</h3>

            <p>
              Bob decides to have a chat with other indy workers that are in a
              similar situation. He steps into the cafe and jumps on the kiosk.
              He orders coffee and then chooses the plan. The kiosk remembers
              the plan he chose at the registration phase. He then takes the ice
              breaker that could initiate a conversation.
            </p>
            <p><img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/crcr/crcr-06.png" /></p>

            <p>
              Bob checks out the availability of the tables to locate which
              table he wants to join. After deciding where to sit, the colored
              light pops up on the table he registered.
            </p>
            <p><img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/crcr/crcr-07.png" /></p>
            <p></p>

            <h3>USE CASE 3 Activities inside the cafe</h3>

            <p>
              Bob uses the mobile APP to explore the community. There are more
              function unlocked upon his arriving. One of that is skill trade,
              where he can either trade his skill in different ways, or find
              some skillful person.
            </p>
            <p><img alt="Git Bash" src="../assets/img/crcr/crcr-08.png" /></p>

            <p>
              Fidelity Care is another key function on the mobile, it is where
              users can get Fidelity’s help with finance, career and mental
              health all in one place. User can monitor the overall status, and
              directly schedule an appointment with Fidelity specialist for
              help.
