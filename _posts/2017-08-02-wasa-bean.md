This project aims to help Chinese design students to easily find a suitable software tutorial. Many Chinese universities don’t provide enough design software training, students have to learn by themselves. However, the current learning experience is not very friendly, it makes many students be afraid of studying software. The final idea comes from the way of students doing design works. The app, Wasa Bean, will provide detail software process to help students learn from design work which interests them.

## PROBLEM ANALYSIS
Imitation is a great way to learn software. Most of students start with imitate others’ design work. However online website doesn’t provide too much information to help them learn others’ work.
