Gender stereotype is initially generated between 3-5 years old and it is difficult to be changed since then. Therefore, it is curtail period to lead them to have a proper attitude towards gender, to ensure that people‘s development and talent not be limited by their gender. 

And they should be encouraged to have good qualities no matter it is “girlish” or “manly”.

### Game as the Medium
For kids aged 3-5, playing game is their main activity, as well as the way they gather knowledges and form personali- ties. Game is the joint of the elements above. Unfortunately but typically, parents choose the game for children when they buy certain toy in the market, and children also conduct gendered play with each other.
