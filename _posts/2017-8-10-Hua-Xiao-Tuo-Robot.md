<p> Elderly care has become a thorny issue, especially in the ward, professional care workers are in severe shortage. In this situation, the healthcare robot came into being.
A healthcare robot can be accompanied by an elderly person who is disable to take care of themselves and make the life in the ward no longer depressing.</p>

<h2>Background research</h2>

<p>Findings from this phase</p>

<p> In China, the hospital service is not stratified and Everyone tend to choose large, guaran-
teed public hospitals for medical treatment, resulting in the crowding of patients.
Medical resources are limited in hospital and the medical level is not balanced. It causes the issue that patients’ medical difficulties can not be effectively solved.</p>

<h2>Further research</h2>

<p>We came to Xinhua Hospital and observed the general situation in hospital and the living condition of the patients. Meanwhile, we visited 15 people, having deep conversation with them.
We got aware of people’s daily life during hospital stay, the demands of people in different positions and the estrangement during communication.

<h2>Analysis</h2>

<p>Patients have both basic needs and emotional needs, and most of those needs should be met with others’ partici- pation. However, because of the limited resources and absence of proper tools, many barriers have appeared. These are the places where we can work. </p>

<h2>Introducing of robot</h2>

<ul><li>Robot is directly connected with online data, so it can bridge the infomation gap.</li><li>Robot is always online, so it can care when human is absent. </li><li>Robot have a natural interaction with human, so it can support emotional fuction. </li></ul>

<h2>Form development</h2>

<p>We design its form, according to its functions and the ideal image it will present, and adjust it to contain all structures and hardwares</p>
