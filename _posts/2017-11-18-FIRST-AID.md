description: Falling down is a huge threat to the elderly’s health, as it may worsen many acute diseases like cerebral hemorrhage. When this accident happens time is crucial, but the elderly sometimes cannot cry for help. In order to provide seniors with emergency first aid, I designed this set of wearable devices to bridge the gap between people who need help and those who offer a hand.

  <h3> Problem </h3>
  <p>
    Falls pose huge risks to the health of seniors, the group who are usually afflicted with multiple chronic diseases. For them, falling can be more severe than that experienced by other groups, sometimes even resulting in death. Facing this life
    risk, however, most of the elderly are unable to prevent, sometimes they cannot even cry out.
  </p>

  <h3> Solution </h3>
  <p>
    In order to provide the injured seniors with first-aid, I designed a system integrating public resources, social relationships, and tangible projects. These touch points all react immediately when a senior falls. First, falling of user will be
    detected by the smart suit which also works like a cushion and an alarm. Then the “First Aid” system will report this falling event, simultaneously to surrounding volunteers and to the public health system through the internet. They will both
    offer help to the injured seniors for timely treatment.

  <h2>Background Research </h2>
    <img src="/images/FirstAid/FirstAid-img-02.svg" alt="" >
    
  <p>
    Over the past two decades, China’s population has been aging rapidly. As a result of China’s “one-child” policy and low mortality, the proportion of elderly citizens will continue to grow very quickly, increasing the stress on an already
    troubled
    health care system. Most of them surfer from chronic diseases and have to take care of themselves.

  <h2>Further Research & Problem Analysis  </h2>
  <p>
  According to NHS report, around one in three adults over 65 living at home experience at least one fall a year, and about half of them falls more frequently. Most falls don't result in serious injury. However, most of Chinese seniors have
  circulation system disease,such as hypertension, cerebrovascular disease and diabetes mellitus. If they fall down, it can cause serious harm, or even death.

  In this topic I would like to explore what changes or even new possibilities in the state of exchange between people, behavior and relationships can be brought with the use of public systems and the interaction between people.
